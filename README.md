USED MS EXCEL FOR THE DATASET HERE...
Data set taken netflix messy dataset with 9000 rows and with added messy columns and duplicates..
instead of using kaggle , i myself created a synthentic dataset with rows contained 9000 and ...
by generating a python code i imported the data by using the generated py code which used in here as excel netflix series and tv show dataset file..
and ensured first row is recognised correctly as column as column headers and the delimeter is seperated usually as comma ,...
used freeze panes in my specific style to freeze the top header row while i move the entire columns up not to get any further confusion or disturbance ...
also applied filter on all the columns of the dataset ...
identified missing values using filter >blank values and highlighted them using conditional formatting then decided to leave the blanks as it self incase added them with a unique colour based on the column context ..
detected duplicates using remove duplicates based on key columns like title but before deleting created a backup tab incase to avaoid the whole file deletion and stored the file in the secondary place..
and couldn't removed the duplicated specifically due to the dataset that i picked contain similar range value names whih makes it unwantedly non-removable due to the choice..
incase i added the highlight option which made it not to remove any based on the dataset taken..
and also Standardize text fields using functions like TRIM, UPPER,..
and also Converted incorrect formats by validating date columns (YYYY-MM-DD)..
